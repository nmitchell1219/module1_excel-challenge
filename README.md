# Excel Challenge

In the Crowdfunding Analysis Challenge, I dove into a dataset of 1,000 projects from platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo to uncover the secrets behind successful and unsuccessful campaigns. My task involved using Excel to meticulously organize, analyze, and manipulate the data, employing techniques such as conditional formatting, categorization, and statistical analysis. My goal was to pinpoint the key factors that influence a campaign's outcome. 


#### Statistical Analysis:<br>
I believe that using the median better summarizes the data because there are very large variances within both successful and failed campaigns. There is more variability with successful campaigns. This makes sense because looking at the data, the total campaign and backer count is much higher, there is a larger gap between minimum and maximum backer count, and the standard deviation is higher.
